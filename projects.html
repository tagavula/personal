            The technique of Vipassana Meditation is taught at ten-day residential courses during 
            which participants learn the basics of the method, and practice sufficiently to experience 
            its beneficial results. There are no charges for the courses - not even to cover the cost of 
            food and accommodation. All expenses are met by donations from people who, having completed a 
            course and experienced the benefits of Vipassana, wish to give others the opportunity to also benefit.
